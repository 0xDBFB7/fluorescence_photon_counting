<p>Biotium GelGreen has a very specific advantage: to increase the safety of the dye, the flurophore is tied to some huge proprietary molecule, preventing it from diffusing through membranes or capsids. This has the side effect of making the fluorescence intensity strictly related to the quantity of genomic material dispersed in the solvent, rather than</p>
<p>Luckily, a recent paper has the answer: direct fluorescent detection of DNA in solution, outside using dyes that bind to (intercalate into) DNA. GelGreen doesn’t penetrate.</p>
<p>A similar method (using fluroescence microscopy rather than photon counting) was also used by, and is generally a common practice in the bioeffects field.</p>

<p>For one thing, GelGreen appears to be eminiently stable - samples can be stored for long periods of time, pre-mixed batches.</p>

<p>As noted by [xi?], this is a saturating effect; if too many flurophores intercalate into the DNA the fluorescence is weaker.</p>

<p>Various impromptu tests were made with a 2.5W 445 nm laser cutter. Commodity blue 445 nm emitters only barely clip the absorption spectrum of GelGreen, apparently leading to a poor fluorescence yield. Combined with the very high intensity, an unusably high background was found even with the large 0.4 mL test sample. This observation were tainted by a very poor optical arrangement and was largely inconclusive; 445 nm laser diode alone was never tested with the final optical arrangement, and may well have provided sufficient. This may allow the elimination of the excitation filter.</p>
<p>(Note that inexpensive laser cutter modules are often intensity modulated via PWM rather than via analog current; this can cause great confusion if not accounted for).</p>
<p>gel doc papers use leds without filters, and paper says narrow leds exist, talk about results with leds</p>
<p>Blue LEDs [Cree XLamp XP-E2 Blue Starboard] are then sufficient for excitation (though high CRI white LEDs emit more 480 nm blue, green leakage is too high).</p>
<p>Cree recommends staying below 300% of the continuous power when modulating an LED.</p>
<p>A white LED with a high color-rendering index (DK) seemed to have more power in the blue passband; however, green leakage around the filter was too strong.</p>
<p>Arranging the light source physically at right angles can be challenging. Using a plastic fiber optic assists in positioning "because of the small numerical aperture". The fiber optic <span class="citation" data-cites="vurek1982nanoliter">(<a href="#ref-vurek1982nanoliter" role="doc-biblioref">Vurek 1982</a>)</span></p>

<p>Arranging the light source and detector optical paths at right angles is the first line of defense against excitation light bleed-through. In testing, is echoed by <span class="citation" data-cites="Optical2011">(<a href="#ref-Optical2011" role="doc-biblioref">Erdogan 2011</a>)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, it is possible to excite a sample from one side and collect the fluorescence from the opposite side (Fig. 2.4.3D). While some instruments, such as microplate readers, use this approach, it is rare because it is difficult to completely prevent scattered excitation light from reaching the detector.</p>
<p>Even when thin-film filters with extremely high blocking are used, high-angle scattered light can make it through the emission filter, since, as shown below, the spectrum of the filter shifts to shorter wavelengths for light at higher angles of incidence, thus causing the shifted emitter band to overlap with the excitation wavelength band.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="Optical2011">(<a href="#ref-Optical2011" role="doc-biblioref">Erdogan 2011</a>)</span> "These filters should also be specified to have very low ripple in the passband, since the narrow laser lines of some lasers (especially semiconductor diode lasers) can drift over time or with changing environmental conditions, thus resulting in fluctuations of the filtered laser power."</p>
<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>
<p>Certainly the most critical aspect of any fluorescence technique is the filter set used.</p>
<p>Important characteristics include transmission % inside the passband, optical density outside the passband, and sharp edges without long tails crossing the so-called Stokes shift<span class="citation" data-cites="Stokes2021">(<a href="#ref-Stokes2021" role="doc-biblioref"><span>“Stokes Shift”</span> 2021</a>)</span> between absorption and emission. Some filters have ripple far from the edge of interest which must be taken into account when assessing the overall filtering performance.</p>

<p>Half-inch diameter laser line filters were used here for reasons of cost. As of this writing, a set of quality GFP filters costs about 4 times as much as a laser line set. Due to narrower pass-bands, perhaps 1/8 optical performance can be expected; in a photon-counting mode, however, there appears to be ample sensitivity remaining.</p>
<p>Superior filters can almost certainly be found; these were chosen for convenience.</p>
<p>Gel-docs , with spectra specified using the Wratten scale. These filters alone do not seem to have optical density values sufficient for amplification-free quantitation at these levels.</p>
<p>Most commercial microscopes use dichroic beamsplitters, allowing the excitation and emission beam to go through the same objective, a technique known as epifluorescence (epi- means same-side). The dichroic only removes the excitation to the 1% level - you still need the dielectric filters, and they’re really expensive. With fiber optic excitation at right angles to the objective, excitation scattering was low enough that the dichroic was unnecessary.</p>

One layer of Kapton tape was wrapped around the filter to protect other optics from the sharp edges.</p>
<p>Tiffen-brand filters consist of two glass panes sandwiching a plastic membrane that contains the dye proper. They can be cut to size</p>
<p>The 10 nm FWHM emission filter is much narrower than professional GFP filters, especially the super-wide edge-pass ones; a lot of photons are lost that way, decreasing efficiency. However, it still appears to be more than sufficient.</p>
<p>manuals for gel-docs typically suggest #16 or #15. SYBR recommends #15.</p>
<p>For an even lower-cost system, orange or amber acrylic sheets (typically used for UV filtering) with similar filtering spectra (e.g. Acrylite 408-5) also exist; such a filter is used on the Carolina gel-doc, for instance.</p>

<p>Unlike gels or plastic-glass sandwiches, thin-film filters have the property that the pass-band depends greatly on the angle of incidence as <span class="math display">\[\lambda_{\text{shifted}} = \lambda \sqrt{1-\sin(\theta)^2}\]</span></p>
<p>The wavelength shifts shorter (bluer) as <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> increases. This can be a helpful property for creating tunable filters, but is a nuisance here. This isn’t an issue for the excitation filter, but is an issue for the.</p>
<p>Thin-film dielectric filters also age; ThorLabs considers filters to have a lifetime of 2 years.</p>
<p>Since the LEDs and flurophore emissions are not naturally collimated, this poses a little bit of an issue. The microscope objective seems to provide sufficient collimation for the emission filter.</p>
<p>The Edmund filter was unmounted glass. Also, these thin-film filters do not extend to the edge of the glass. Edge-blackening ("inked") filters</p>
<p>The wavelength can also be shifted by a few nm over the temperature range 0 to 50</p>
<p>The LED was about 3 cm away, and put through a  3 mm aperture in a piece of PVC pipe. The output from the filter was directly into the 1 mm fiber, itself improving the bandpass.</p>

<p>An even better Phase-shift time domain fluorimetry. Iwata use a 20 MHz DSO to measure a 5 ns <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> fluorophore. However, this involves a light source with a fast modulation bandwidth; and in the implementation they describe, the PMT must be in the voltage mode.</p>

<p>While there are ways to deconvolve a slow falling edge, there’s another problem: per time interval, the time spent in the excitation-off, flurophore exponential decay time is proportional to the frequency of the excitation light. If you’re only getting 1000 photons from the sample per second, the dye lifetime is 5 ns, and you’re turning the light on and off at 1 MHz, you’re only getting a [] photons from the exponential decay region. Even with a long exposure, that doesn’t seem to be enough to pick up the decay.</p>
<p>It is also possible to perform flashbulb. <span class="citation" data-cites="Instrument1957">(<a href="#ref-Instrument1957" role="doc-biblioref">Brody 1957</a>)</span> abuse of pmts. Note that as long as average current limits are obeyed, PMTs are happy to endure very high pulse currents, like flashbulbs for exciting; no shutters or anything required. Gating the photomultiplier HV is another technique. Figure out the average current limit for your PMT, the expected voltage based on your load resistor value and watch that it never exceeds it.</p>
<p>Another way to pick up this phase shift is to make your lock-in amplifier phase-sensitive - very simple (a 2x clock put into a flip-flop divider, then the middle). This also wasn’t nearly good enough, completely useless.</p>

<p>One might expect, given that white noise has an expectation value of zero, that this technique would average out to 0, and the signal would be linearly proportional to time. However, a 1-dimensional random walk with a uniform step size of 1 is expected to end up <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{N}\)</span> units away from the origin after N steps. In the same time, a fluorophore emitting at a rate of <span class="math inline">\(r=1\)</span> counts per step has an expected value of N counts (a Poisson distribution has a mean equal to its parameter). Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\text{SNR} = \frac{N}{\sqrt{N}} = \sqrt{N}\)</span>. Longer exposure times would therefore provide better precision, but with diminishing returns.</p>
<p>A more comprehensive consideration <span class="citation" data-cites="Signala">(<a href="#ref-Signala" role="doc-biblioref">Stanford Research Systems n.d.</a>)</span></p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>it has been noted that water is a good fluorescence quencher and that this might be how</p>
<p>If time-domain filtering is sufficient,</p>
<p>Low background is required.</p>
<p>Contrary to standard microscopy, you want as little excitation light to enter the objective as possible. Using the existing</p>
<p>the input edge is considered a clock; the minimum pulse width limits apply, but are not clearly specified in the datasheet. In this case (1/155 mhz) = 6 ns.</p>
<p>However, we had no luck with precipitation.</p>
<p>With the setup we’re using and the small quantities, the excitation light is somewhere around  <span class="math inline">\(10^5\)</span> times as powerful as the emission. This doesn’t seem to be a big issue gel-docs, picking out bands on gels - they don’t usually seem to use excitation filters; however, to get the excitation bleed-through low enough to do this quantitative assay, the bleed-through must be really low, and in our testing proper dielectric filters are required on both the excitation and emission sides.</p>
<p>There are a few sources of noise:</p>
<p>PMT dark counts Some be filtered out by judicious use of comparator pulse height threshold, the lock-in takes care of it. A non-issue in our case. Ambient light leakage It’ll be fine. Even with the room lights Using microscope optics and the lock-in, essentially a non-issue for use, surprisingly. Some fluorescence microscopes use micron-size apertures to limit the depth of field to avoid Putting</p>

<p>The PMT was at maximum sensitivity (in fact, slightly above max voltage)</p>
<p>You might be wondering why the filters are even required - why not just subtract the excitation bleed-through with a control? Unfortunately, any miniscule variation in the scattering of the excitation will be orders of magnitude larger than the fluorescence signal you’re looking for.</p>
<p>Some papers discuss adding a third chopper or gate period or photomultiplier or to measure the drift of the excitation light source. Putting some feedback in the loop would probably</p>
